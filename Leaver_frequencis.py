This script aims to calculate the Quasi-Normal mode frequencies of Kerr 
(and Scwharzchild as a special case of Kerr) black hole pertubations 
using the equations outlined in Leaver 1985.

#Â 1. Definitions and Inputs

    # Define fraction function 
def fraction(a,b):
    return a/b 

    # Define equations for coefficients and other relevant equations 
def alpha_theta_n(n):
    pass

def beta_theta_n():
    pass

def gamm_theta_n():
    pass

# 2. Implement method to calculate roots of continued fraction equation

    # Define continued fraction equation
def continued_fraction_Alm():
    pass 

def continued_fraction_w():
    pass 

    # Calculate roots 
def calculate_roots():
    pass #return list_of_real_w, list_of_imaginary_w

# 3. Output the results of the calculation

    # Store real and Imaginary parts of the frequency in a csv file

    # Plot an argand diagram for the calculated frequencies, may be able to find some cool 
    # visuals for this
